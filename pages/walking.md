## Target Audience:
All

## Country: 
All

I suggest we all agree to keep to the outside lane unless over taking?
Definition: Outside means closes to the building or furthers away from the road.

## Country: Australia:
Please keep left when walking!

## Country: Japan
Some parts of Japan keep left, some keep right.
Let's discuss here!

## United States.
Keep right unless overtaking.


When walking (not so much in a non-crowded city/town before or after peek hour(s)), try to keep to the same rules as driving where applicable or as mush as possible e.g. "Keep Right Left Overtaking".

Mobile / Cell Devices.
Please avoid using your mobile devices while moving, simply pull over to the left (out of the way), stop and then start reading, writing on you mobile phone, tablet, smart watch etc.

##Applies to.
Walkways.
Footpath.
Road.
Escalators.
Mountain bike riding.
Bike Riding.

##Why:
There is always others that walk faster than you or in a hurry.
You have no write to block, restrict or control others destiny.
