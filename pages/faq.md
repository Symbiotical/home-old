## Responsabilities

### Physical Phone / Device?
* You (owner) are responsible for the safe keeping and maintinance of the physical device.
* If you are prone to loosing or breaking it, most carriers now have insurance options.
* If you loan to a someone, you are still responsible, not the supplier (Not phone company or carrier).
* Most device suppliers have an "Unfair Wear And Tear" policy. Basically this means if the device is faulty due to a manufacturing fault, they MAY repair, swap for a pre-owned device or replace with new device).
* If the device companies determine it is "Unfair Wear And Tear", they can repair, replace with pre-ownded at your cost after quote provided.
* Note: Inside every device there is a piece of material (like litmous paper) that changes colour if moisture is present, so be honest if you drop down the toilet :) or buy the water resistant / proof phones.

---

### Network or Availability to make a call.
* Both you and your Carrier is reponsible for providing a service as per your contract.
* You need to keep your phone in a working state and be in range of cell towers.
* Before you decide on a Carrier, go online (Internet) and ask for a "Coverage Maps" for your main (home or work) area.
* No Carrier in the world will Garantee 100% coverage 100% of the time. Please read the contract BEFORE complaining!
* Most contracts by most carriers do have a clause stating that it is impossible to proved 100% service or phone coverage for 100% of the time due to multiple reasons i.e. It is physically not possible to have a working phone if your phone is encased within a conductive/metal container like your garden shed or underground like in some tunnels etc.
* Satellite phone need to be in "Line Of Site" to the sky (You must be Outside) i.e. Satellite phone are much more sensative to interference from buildings, tin sheds, trees, wet trees, clouds and even solar flares etc.

### SIM.
* You are responsible for your physical SIM card, yet they can easily be replaced.
* Some Carriers will replace for free.

## What is a SIM Card.
* A small plastic card inserted into most devices.
* It is linked to your phone number, so you can insert into other devices if required.
* Your SIM card is managed and supplied by your carrier.
* There is possability in the near future new devices my not use SIM cards.

### My personal data (Contacts, Phone Numbers, Songs Etc) on device.
* You. Make sure you have multiple backups of your personal data i.e. your friends phone numbers.
* No one but you (Or your work if work phone) is responsible for loosing your data.
* Some suppliers / carriers have a Cloud "Backup Service" e.g. Apple iCloud.
* I STRONGLY suggest making it a habbit to backup all your personal data and config once a month or at least once every 6 months using 3rd party software".
* NEVER PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET!!"
